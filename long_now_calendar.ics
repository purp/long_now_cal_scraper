 bal power is shifting from the West to the Restâfrom Europe and North
  America to Asia and Africa. He argues that changes will be required both 
 in the West and the Rest to manage the shift gracefully for long-term stab
 ility.  The rest of the world has learned a great deal from the West.  Now
  it is the Westâs turn to learn and to dispel some of its myths about
  the new world order.\n\nSingaporean diplomat and scholar Kishore Mahbuban
 i served as his nationâs Ambassador to the United Nations and as Pres
 ident of the UN Security Council.  He is a Professor in the Practice of Pu
 blic Policy at the National University of Singapore where he was Dean of t
 he Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy from 2004 to 2017.  His books incl
 ude Has the West Lost It?: A Provocation  (2018)\;  The ASEAN Miracle  (20
 17)\;  The Great Convergence  (2013)\; and  The New Asian Hemisphere  (200
 8).\n\nThe Long Now Foundation and Asia Society Northern California are pa
 rtnering on a series of talks in Long Now's Seminars About Long-term Think
 ing series. With the Asia Pacific region being vital to long term thinking
  for the planet\, and especially for those on the Pacific coast\, we belie
 ve that there is a fruitful collaboration to explore for our both of our m
 emberships and the wider public.\n\nThe Asia Society's depth of knowledge 
 about critical issues\, key leaders and cultural perspectives coming out o
 f Asia can inform the topics\, people and conversations featured in the lo
 ng-running Seminar series curated and hosted by Long Now's president Stewa
 rt Brand. Public access to the recorded talks broadens the reach of this i
 n-depth collaboration.
