  Kishore Mahbubaniâs view\, global power is shifting from the West to
  the Restâfrom Europe and North America to Asia and Africa. He argues
  that changes will be required both in the West and the Rest to manage the
  shift gracefully for long-term stability.  The rest of the world has lear
 ned a great deal from the West.  Now it is the Westâs turn to learn a
 nd to dispel some of its myths about the new world order.\n\nSingaporean d
 iplomat and scholar Kishore Mahbubani served as his nationâs Ambassad
 or to the United Nations and as President of the UN Security Council.  He 
 is a Professor in the Practice of Public Policy at the National University
  of Singapore where he was Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Polic
 y from 2004 to 2017.  His books include Has the West Lost It?: A Provocati
 on  (2018)\;  The ASEAN Miracle  (2017)\;  The Great Convergence  (2013)\;
  and  The New Asian Hemisphere  (2008).\n\nThe Long Now Foundation and Asi
 a Society Northern California are partnering on a series of talks in Long 
 Now's Seminars About Long-term Thinking series. With the Asia Pacific regi
 on being vital to long term thinking for the planet\, and especially for t
 hose on the Pacific coast\, we believe that there is a fruitful collaborat
 ion to explore for our both of our memberships and the wider public.\n\nTh
 e Asia Society's depth of knowledge about critical issues\, key leaders an
 d cultural perspectives coming out of Asia can inform the topics\, people 
 and conversations featured in the long-running Seminar series curated and 
 hosted by Long Now's president Stewart Brand. Public access to the recorde
 d talks broadens the reach of this in-depth collaboration.\n
